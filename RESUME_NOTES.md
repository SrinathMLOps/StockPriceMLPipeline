## üé§ **ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)**

*"I built a complete MLOps pipeline that predicts stock prices in real-time with 99.82% accuracy. The system manages a portfolio of 5 major stocks, provides trading signals, and serves predictions via API with 19ms response time. It's production-ready with Docker containers, comprehensive testing, and can scale to handle thousands of requests per second. The entire system demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering from data ingestion to model serving."*
