# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements enterprise-grade distributed GPU training capabilities for the stock price prediction model using Azure ML. The system will leverage multi-node GPU clusters to demonstrate scalable MLOps practices, cost optimization, and production-ready distributed computing for machine learning workloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GPU Compute Cluster Management

**User Story:** As an ML Engineer, I want to provision and manage GPU compute clusters dynamically, so that I can scale training workloads efficiently while optimizing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a distributed training job is submitted THEN the system SHALL provision a 3-node GPU cluster with Tesla V100 or equivalent GPUs
2. WHEN the cluster is idle for more than 10 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically scale down to minimize costs
3. WHEN cluster provisioning fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative GPU SKUs and log detailed error information
4. IF cluster resources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue the job and notify when resources become available

### Requirement 2: Distributed Training Implementation

**User Story:** As a Data Scientist, I want to train models across multiple GPUs and nodes simultaneously, so that I can reduce training time and handle larger datasets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL distribute the workload across all available GPU nodes
2. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically shard the dataset across nodes to prevent duplication
3. WHEN gradients are computed THEN the system SHALL synchronize gradients across all nodes using AllReduce operations
4. IF a node fails during training THEN the system SHALL recover from the latest checkpoint and continue with remaining nodes
5. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL aggregate final model weights from all participating nodes

### Requirement 3: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As an MLOps Engineer, I want to monitor training performance across all nodes in real-time, so that I can optimize resource utilization and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributed training runs THEN the system SHALL log GPU utilization, memory usage, and throughput for each node
2. WHEN communication overhead exceeds 20% of total training time THEN the system SHALL alert and suggest optimization strategies
3. WHEN training metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide per-node and aggregate performance dashboards
4. IF GPU memory utilization drops below 70% THEN the system SHALL recommend batch size adjustments

### Requirement 4: Fault Tolerance and Checkpointing

**User Story:** As an ML Engineer, I want the training process to be resilient to node failures, so that long-running training jobs can complete successfully without losing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL create checkpoints every 100 iterations across all nodes
2. WHEN a node failure is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically restart training from the latest checkpoint
3. WHEN checkpoints are saved THEN the system SHALL store them in Azure Blob Storage with versioning
4. IF all nodes fail THEN the system SHALL preserve the latest checkpoint and allow manual restart

### Requirement 5: Cost Management and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a Project Manager, I want to track and optimize GPU compute costs, so that I can maintain budget control while maximizing training efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training job is submitted THEN the system SHALL estimate total compute costs before execution
2. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdown by node and time
3. WHEN cluster utilization drops below 50% THEN the system SHALL recommend downsizing or spot instance usage
4. IF training exceeds estimated cost by 25% THEN the system SHALL alert and provide cost optimization recommendations

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing MLOps Pipeline

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer, I want the distributed training to integrate seamlessly with existing Azure ML pipelines, so that I can maintain consistent deployment and monitoring workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributed training completes THEN the system SHALL register the model in Azure ML Model Registry with distributed training metadata
2. WHEN experiments are tracked THEN the system SHALL log all distributed training metrics to Azure ML Experiments
3. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL support deployment of distributed-trained models using existing serving infrastructure
4. IF integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with existing model serving endpoints
