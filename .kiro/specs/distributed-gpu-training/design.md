## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Compute Cluster Manager

**Purpose:** Manages GPU cluster lifecycle and resource allocation

**Key Classes:**
- `GPUClusterManager`: Handles cluster provisioning and scaling
- `ResourceOptimizer`: Monitors utilization and recommends optimizations
- `CostTracker`: Tracks and reports compute costs

**Interfaces:**
```python
class GPUClusterManager:
    def provision_cluster(self, node_count: int, gpu_type: str) -> ClusterConfig
    def scale_cluster(self, target_nodes: int) -> bool
    def monitor_health(self) -> ClusterHealth
    def cleanup_cluster(self) -> None
```

### 2. Distributed Training Coordinator

**Purpose:** Orchestrates distributed training across multiple nodes

**Key Classes:**
- `DistributedTrainer`: Main training orchestrator
- `DataShardManager`: Handles data distribution across nodes
- `GradientSynchronizer`: Manages gradient aggregation
- `CheckpointManager`: Handles fault tolerance and recovery

**Interfaces:**
```python
class DistributedTrainer:
    def initialize_distributed(self, world_size: int, rank: int) -> None
    def setup_data_parallel(self, model: torch.nn.Module) -> torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel
    def train_epoch(self, dataloader: DataLoader) -> Dict[str, float]
    def synchronize_metrics(self, metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, float]
```

### 3. Performance Monitor

**Purpose:** Real-time monitoring of training performance and resource utilization

**Key Classes:**
- `NodeMonitor`: Tracks per-node metrics
- `CommunicationProfiler`: Monitors inter-node communication overhead
- `PerformanceDashboard`: Aggregates and visualizes metrics

**Interfaces:**
```python
class NodeMonitor:
    def collect_gpu_metrics(self) -> GPUMetrics
    def collect_network_metrics(self) -> NetworkMetrics
    def collect_training_metrics(self) -> TrainingMetrics
    def send_to_dashboard(self, metrics: Dict) -> None
```

## Data Models

### ClusterConfig
```python
@dataclass
class ClusterConfig:
    cluster_name: str
    node_count: int
    gpu_type: str  # e.g., "Standard_NC6s_v3"
    auto_scale_enabled: bool
    min_nodes: int
    max_nodes: int
    idle_timeout_minutes: int
```

### DistributedTrainingConfig
```python
@dataclass
class DistributedTrainingConfig:
    world_size: int
    backend: str  # "nccl" for GPU
    master_addr: str
    master_port: int
    batch_size_per_gpu: int
    gradient_accumulation_steps: int
    checkpoint_frequency: int
```

### TrainingMetrics
```python
@dataclass
class TrainingMetrics:
    node_id: int
    epoch: int
    step: int
    loss: float
    gpu_utilization: float
    gpu_memory_used: float
    throughput_samples_per_sec: float
    communication_time_ms: float
    timestamp: datetime
```

### CostMetrics
```python
@dataclass
class CostMetrics:
    cluster_name: str
    total_cost_usd: float
    cost_per_node_hour: float
    training_duration_hours: float
    cost_per_epoch: float
    estimated_total_cost: float
```

## Error Handling

### Node Failure Recovery
1. **Detection:** Health checks every 30 seconds detect unresponsive nodes
2. **Isolation:** Failed nodes are removed from the training group
3. **Recovery:** Training continues with remaining nodes from latest checkpoint
4. **Replacement:** New nodes can be added dynamically if available

### Communication Failures
1. **Timeout Handling:** 60-second timeout for gradient synchronization
2. **Retry Logic:** 3 automatic retries with exponential backoff
3. **Fallback:** Switch to parameter server mode if AllReduce fails
4. **Logging:** Detailed communication error logs for debugging

### Resource Exhaustion
1. **Memory Monitoring:** Track GPU memory usage per node
2. **Batch Size Adjustment:** Automatically reduce batch size if OOM occurs
3. **Gradient Checkpointing:** Enable memory-efficient training for large models
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Fall back to CPU training if GPU resources exhausted

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Cluster Management:** Test cluster provisioning, scaling, and cleanup
- **Data Sharding:** Verify correct data distribution across nodes
- **Gradient Synchronization:** Test AllReduce operations with mock data
- **Checkpoint Recovery:** Validate checkpoint save/load functionality

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-End Training:** Complete distributed training run with synthetic data
- **Fault Tolerance:** Simulate node failures during training
- **Cost Tracking:** Verify accurate cost calculation and reporting
- **Azure ML Integration:** Test experiment logging and model registration

### Performance Tests
- **Scaling Efficiency:** Measure training speedup with 1, 2, and 3 nodes
- **Communication Overhead:** Profile inter-node communication costs
- **Memory Utilization:** Test with various batch sizes and model sizes
- **Cost Optimization:** Validate auto-scaling and resource optimization

### Load Tests
- **Concurrent Jobs:** Multiple distributed training jobs simultaneously
- **Large Dataset:** Training with datasets exceeding single-node memory
- **Extended Training:** Long-running training jobs (>24 hours)
- **Resource Contention:** Training under resource-constrained conditions

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **VNet Integration:** All nodes communicate within Azure VNet
- **Firewall Rules:** Restrict communication to training ports only
- **TLS Encryption:** Secure inter-node communication channels

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest:** All checkpoints and data encrypted in Blob Storage
- **Access Control:** Role-based access to compute resources and data
- **Audit Logging:** Complete audit trail of all training operations

### Credential Management
- **Managed Identity:** Use Azure Managed Identity for service authentication
- **Key Vault Integration:** Secure storage of sensitive configuration
- **Least Privilege:** Minimal required permissions for each component
