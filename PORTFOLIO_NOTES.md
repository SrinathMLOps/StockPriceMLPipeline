## 📊 **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **The Challenge:**
```
"87% of machine learning projects never reach production. Most ML systems are 
built as proof-of-concepts that can't handle real-world scale, reliability, 
or business requirements.

In financial markets, traders and portfolio managers need:
• Real-time predictions with sub-second latency
• Multi-asset portfolio optimization
• Reliable systems with 99.9% uptime
• Scalable architecture for institutional use
• Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance"
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Business Impact**: $1.2T+ managed by algorithmic trading systems
- **Technical Challenge**: Real-time ML at scale is complex
- **Market Need**: Growing demand for MLOps engineers
- **Personal Goal**: Demonstrate production ML engineering skills

---

## 🚀 **SOLUTION OVERVIEW**

### **What I Built:**
```
A complete MLOps ecosystem that:
✅ Predicts stock prices for 5 major assets (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN)
✅ Processes real-time market data with sub-second latency
✅ Provides portfolio optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory
✅ Serves predictions via production-ready APIs
✅ Includes comprehensive monitoring and testing
✅ Scales to handle institutional-grade workloads
```

### **Key Innovations:**
- **Multi-Asset Intelligence**: Specialized models for each stock
- **Real-Time Processing**: Live data streaming with WebSocket
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Automated risk-adjusted allocation
- **Production Architecture**: Microservices with full observability
